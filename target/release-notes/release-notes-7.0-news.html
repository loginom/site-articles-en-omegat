Large-Scale Update of Loginom Analytical Platform Loginom became cross-platform. Standard and Enterprise editions are available for Linux and Windows operating systems. Integration with Kafka message broker became possible. New features appeared in JavaScript handler when importing data from files as well as in OLAP cube visualizer and Reports. Databases operation was improved and optimised. Performance was improved.
<p>When preparing this release, the main efforts were focused on Loginom migration to Linux operating system. The changes affected mostly the technologic platform stack and they are connected with system challenges and libraries, third-party libraries, operations with rows and different integrations. At the same time, 80% percent of the server part was transferred from the previous version, and the client part was not significantly changed. That is why the workflows prepared in Loginom for Windows will be used with Linux as well. In some cases only reconfiguration of nodes will be required.</p>

<p>The most important changes are described below.</p>

<h2 id="ограничения-loginom-под-linux">Loginom Restrictions for Linux</h2>

<ol>
	<li>There is no integration for 1С:Enterprise via COM connection because COM server is available only for Windows. To provide integration with 1С:Enterprise, it is possible to use alternative mechanisms, for example, HTTP protocol.</li>
	<li>It is not possible to connect to <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/integration/connections/list/excel.html" target="_blank">MS Excel</a> as to <strong>database</strong> because there is no software driver for Linux. Only xlsx format is supported (MS Excel 2007 and higher).</li>
	<li>There is no built-in integration with <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/integration/connections/list/msaccess.html" target="_blank">MS Access</a> because open source driver is not available.</li>
	<li>There is no export to Tableau.</li>
	<li>There is no <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/integration/exec-program.html" target="_blank">Program execution</a> handler that is used to start the external Windows programs.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="опциональные-возможности-loginom-под-linux">Optional Loginom Features for Linux</h2>

<p>Logging in journald is available in Linux. Corresponding configurable parameter is provided on Loginom <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/admin/" target="_blank">Administration</a> page. systemd.so.0 library is required to use the logging method (it is available for sure if systemd initialization system is used in Linux distribution kit).</p>

<h2 id="интеграция-с-брокером-сообщений-kafka">Integration with Kafka Message Broker</h2>

<p>Kafka Apache is a popular distributed system of message exchange between server applications in real time. Due to its high capacity, scalability and failure safety it is applied in large-scale projects with large volumes of data.</p>

<p>Import and export of messages to Kafka queue became possible in Loginom Enterprise. <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/integration/connections/list/kafka.html" target="_blank">Integration with Kafka</a> is provided according to the same principle as integration with databases. Connection is configured at the first stage, and then the nodes based on Kafka import or export components are used.</p>

<h2 id="улучшение-в-работе-с-базами-данных">Database Use Improvements</h2>

<p>Considerable work aimed at improvement and optimisation of database use has been done. The following support has been provided:</p>

<ul>
	<li>SCRAM-SHA-256 Authentication and SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS Authentication for PostgreSQL;</li>
	<li>SHA-256 authentication for MySQL 8 when connecting without client use;</li>
	<li>connection to Oracle 18c иand higher without client use;</li>
	<li>Microsoft OLE DB Driver client for SQL Server for connection to MS SQL Server.</li>
</ul>

<p>SQLite database can be used in-memory now. When configuring <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/integration/connections/list/sqlite.html" target="_blank">connection to SQLite database</a>, it is sufficient to select corresponding checkbox and it will be expanded in memory. Data processing speed will be considerably increased in such case of use. While DB is in memory, it is possible to connect to it from another package. Still there is access rights differentiation to DB SQLite in-memory. Database is kept in memory until its connection is active.</p>

<p>It became possible to install inbuilt Firebird client.</p>

<h3 id="обновленный-мастер-настройки-импорта-из-базы-данных">Updated import from database wizard</h3>

<p>Import from database wizard was completely modified. There was not enough space for the request text in the SQL request mode in the previous version, and it was also impossible to see variables and use them. It became much more comfortable to work with SQL requests in the updated wizard:</p>

<ul>
	<li>it became possible to select the "Table selection" or "SQL request" wizard representation mode;</li>
	<li>block with a list of variables was added in the SQL request mode;</li>
	<li>it is possible to drag tables, fields and variables to drag&amp;drop SQL code editor;</li>
	<li>variable value can be inserted into SQL code editor as parameter (by default) or as macro substitution;</li>
	<li>field filtration functionality is available in the SQL request mode in the DB object tree (when tree is expanded);</li>
	<li>it became possible to set the table name via variables;</li>
	<li>loading of DB objects to the tree of objects became faster.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="импорт-из-файлов">Import from Files</h2>

<p>It became possible to read data importing from files (txt, csv, XML, Excel) having executed http request beforehand. For this purpose, URL can be specified instead of the file name in import from file wizard. HTTP Basic Authentication is supported. It means that it is possible to transfer login and password in URL. When importing txt, csv, xml formats for preview or format estimate, only the required data volume is downloaded. When it comes to xlsx format, the whole file is downloaded to memory that is why it is required to pay attention to size of such files.</p>

<h2 id="работа-с-веб-сервисами">Web Services Operation</h2>

<p><a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/integration/rest-request.html" target="_blank">REST</a> and <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/integration/soap-request.html" target="_blank">SOAP request</a> handlers function without changes. However, when transferring workflows between Loginom for Windows and Linux, in some cases it will be required to reconfigure <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/integration/connections/list/rest-service.html" target="_blank">REST</a> connections and <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/integration/connections/list/soap-service.html" target="_blank">SOAP service</a>. Authentification via client certificate is not supported in the Linux version. In Windows it was selected from the storage of personal certificates. When working with Linux, it is required to set the certificate file, key and password.</p>

<p>The default value of "Allowable Content-type of response" parameter was changed in the REST service connection wizard. Instead of <code>*/*</code> <code>application/json</code> is installed.</p>

<p>The output data set will be changed for the packages created before version 6.4.0 in the "Additional data" port of the REST service node. Previously, the value in "Error code" column was equal to 0 irrespective of HTTP Status Code. Now, if HTTP Status Code &gt;= 400, Error Code will be equal to 6.</p>

<h2 id="использование-языков-программирования">Programming languages use</h2>

<p>Now <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/programming/java-script/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> handler  includes <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/programming/java-script/fileapi.html" target="_blank">File Storage API</a> that enables to execute all file operations without rights setup and in a safe manner:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Get file list.</li>
	<li>Create, delete, move, rename folders.</li>
	<li>Delete, move, rename files.</li>
	<li>Check path correctness.</li>
</ul>

<p>It became possible to start <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/programming/python/" target="_blank">Python</a> in a separate process, as well as simultaneously. Start both within the Loginom process and in a separate process is available in Windows editions, whereas operation in Linux is supported only in a separate process.</p>

<p>When sending pandas tables in output_table for column captions in Python, transliteration in prepare_compatible_table function is not performed. This is especially true if captions of pandas columns are written in Cyrillic characters.</p>

<h2 id="улучшения-в-компонентах-обработки">Processing Components Improvements</h2>

<ol>
	<li>When entering data from the keyboard in "Date/time" editors, it is possible to specify only date without time. Previously, it was necessarily required to set time.</li>
	<li>Optional input table port appeared in <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/control/supernode.html" target="_blank">Supernode</a> handler. It enables to make design of workflows more flexible. Port optionality checkbox was added in the <em>Supernode</em> wizard. It is possible to edit the checkbox only for the table port. When collapsing nodes to the<em>Supernode</em>, optionality checkbox is selected only for the input ports related to the Table type to which optional ports are connected inside the <em>Supernode</em>.</li>
	<li>Functions of base64 encoded rows transformation to binary data rows and vice versa are available in <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/transformation/calc/" target="_blank">Calculator</a> in the <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/transformation/calc/javascript.html" target="_blank">JavaScript mode</a>.</li>
	<li>Data caching option was added in <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/transformation/sorting.html" target="_blank">Sorting</a> handler.</li>
	<li>"Replace with set value" processing method became available for all data types in <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/preprocessing/eliminate-outliers.html" target="_blank">Eliminate outliers</a>. Previously, it was possible to use it only for the string and logical types.</li>
	<li>It is allowed to introduce changes compatible with earlier configured lists of selected elements into the XSD schema of request and response. Now such changes do not cause "Input XSD schema does not comply with the node settings" error when activating nodes. The changes concern all nodes in the process of which generation or parsing of xml document is performed according to the schema: <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/integration/import/xml.html" target="_blank">XML file import</a>, <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/integration/export/xml.html" target="_blank">Export to XML</a>, <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/integration/extracting-xml.html" target="_blank">XML extraction</a>, <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/integration/xml-generation.html" target="_blank">XML generation</a>, SOAP request.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="удобство-использования-и-повышение-информативности">Ease of Use and UI/UX Improvements</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Loginom login and password can be transferred in URL now.</li>
	<li>It became possible to add workflow notes. Now it became possible to document workflow directly during its designing by adding text blocks in any place. Pre-installed set of color styles is provided for notes blocks.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="lg-text-img lg-text-img_preview"><a href="/sites/default/files/blogpost-images/notes.png"><img alt="" data-entity-type="" data-entity-uuid="" src="/sites/default/files/blogpost-images/notes.png" /> </a>

<ul>
	<li>It became possible to configure dimensions in a separate window in <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/visualization/cube/" target="_blank">Cube visualizer</a>. The wizard is called using the button from the <em>Cube</em> Toolbar and corresponding context menu item. Previously, after adding each dimension, the <em>Cube</em> was rebuilt, and the <em>Cube</em> configuration took much time for the large data volumes. <em>Cube</em> configuration process became much more comfortable and faster now.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="lg-text-img lg-text-img_preview"><a href="/sites/default/files/blogpost-images/cub_mesure_setting.png"><img alt="" data-entity-type="" data-entity-uuid="" src="/sites/default/files/blogpost-images/cub_mesure_setting.png" /> </a>

<ul>
	<li>It became possible to create subgroups of any nesting level in groups on <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/report/" target="_blank">Reports</a> page.</li>
	<li>On <em>Package variables</em> page <em>Navigation</em> bar became available.</li>
	<li>"Copy full path" item was added to the context menu of the <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/location_user_files.html" target="_blank">file storage</a> manager. When pressing this item, names of the selected files/folders are copied to the clipboard in the order in which they are represented in the table. It is possible to copy to the clipboard only when connecting via https protocol.</li>
	<li>The default action is in bold in all context menus of application.</li>
	<li>Text of the message that is displayed during the long visualizer preparation was changed (for example, when entering <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/visualization/statistics/" target="_blank">Statistics</a> or <em>Cube</em> visualizer when calculations are performed at the moment of activation). Now "Node is locked" is displayed instead of "Loading".</li>
	<li>Tree nodes icons were removed in the <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/interface/property-inspector.html" target="_blank">Property Inspector</a>. It enabled to display the property names more fully under conditions of limited width of the <em>Property Inspector</em> window.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="работа-с-данными">Data Handling</h2>

<p>"Compare string unique values in a binary way" option appeared in the package properties. String comparison will be changed after closing the package and all opened packages dependent on it. When changing "Compare string unique values in a binary way" setting, retraining of trained nodes may be required. The option effect extends to the following components:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/datamining/clustering.html" target="_blank">Clustering</a></li>

</ul>

<p>Value of "Compare string unique values in a binary way" option is displayed in the <em>Property Inspector</em>.</p>

<p>Now it is possible to install Random Seed.in the wizard of the handlers algorithms of which use generation of pseudorandom numbers. Random Seed value can be set via variable, it is also possible to generate or select "Always randomly" checkbox. Command to copy value to the clipboard became available.</p>

<h2 id="изменения-в-loginom-integrator">Changes in Loginom Integrator</h2>

<p><a href="https://help.loginom.ru/adminguide/integrator/" target="_blank">Loginom Integrator</a> configuration file was changed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>web.config file name was replaced with <code>Integrator.dll.config</code>.</li>
	<li><code>appSettings</code>, <code>system.web</code>, <code>system.serviceModel</code> and <code>system.webServer</code> elements were deleted with all child elements.</li>
	<li>
	<p><code>configSections</code> element format was changed:</p>

	<p>before:</p>

	<pre>
<code>  &lt;configSections&gt;
        &lt;section name="log" type="DeductorIntegrationServer.Core.LogConfigurationSection"/&gt;
         &lt;section name="loginom" type="DeductorIntegrationServer.Core.DeductorConfigurationSection"/&gt;
  &lt;/configSections&gt;
</code></pre>

	<p>after:</p>

	<pre>
<code>  &lt;configSections&gt;
        &lt;section name="log" type="Integrator.Core.LogConfigurationSection, IntegratorCore"/&gt;
        &lt;section name="loginom" type="Integrator.Core.LoginomConfigurationSection, IntegratorCore"/&gt;
  &lt;/configSections&gt;
</code></pre>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For <code>loginom</code> element optional <code>urlPathPrefix</code> attribute was added. Its value is used as prefix to address of all REST and SOAP end points. An empty string is the default value of this attribute. For example, if Loginom Integrator is used at the following address: <code>http://localhost/lgi</code>, and <code>urlPathPrefix</code> attribute is not specified, help page for REST is available at the following address: <code>http://localhost/lgi/rest/help</code>. If <code>urlPathPrefix="abc"</code>, address was changed as follows: <code>http://localhost/lgi/abc/rest/help</code>. <strong>To use the same addresses in the new Integrator as in the old one, it is required to specify as follows: </strong> <code>urlPathPrefix="Service.svc"</code>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>For <code>loginom</code> element optional <code>swaggerUI</code> attribute was added. It can take <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> value. The attribute enables/disables generation of  <code>openapi/index.html</code> page that implements access to the published services via Swagger UI.</li>
</ul>

<p>It became possible to set location of Loginom Integrator configuration file. Location of the folder from which <code>Integrator.dll.config</code> and <code>appsettings.json</code> configuration files are downloaded is defined according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>if <code>configdir</code> parameter is specified in the command line, the specified folder is used (the parameter name can be specified in any register;</li>
	<li>if the parameter is not specified and in the current folder (<code>$PWD</code>) there is <code>Integrator.dll.config</code> file, the current folder is used;</li>
	<li>otherwise the folder with <code>Integrator.dll</code> file is used.</li>
</ul>

<p>If there is no <code>Integrator.dll.config</code> file in the specified folder, Integrator is not started, and the user receives an error message.</p>

<p>The relative path to the work Integrator directory is defined relative to the configuration file. If in Integrator.dll.config file the value of <code>workDir</code> attribute is the relative path, it is interpreted as the path relative to Integrator.dll.config file. Value of<code>workDir</code> attribute can be equal to <code>.</code> (current folder). It will mean that <code>workdir</code> matches <code>configdir</code>.</p>

<p>A separate wsdl file is generated for each published package (the earlier description of the SOAP service included content of all published packages). Generation of root wsdl document that refers to all other wsdl documents was added. By default, root wsdl is generated at the following address:<code>/soap?wsdl</code>. If the value of <code>urlPathPrefix="Service.svc"</code> attribute is set in the Loginom configuration file, wsdl is additionally generated by the following address: <code>/Service.svc?wsdl</code> that is used in the old Integrator.</p>

<p>Now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAPI_Specification" target="_blank">OpenAPI</a> and Swagger UI are supported in Loginom Integrator. Now it is possible to execute requests to test API on the following page: <code>http://host/lgi/openapi/index.html</code>.</p>

<p>Now it is possible to connect to Loginom Server via <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%BA%D0%B5%D1%82_%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B0_Unix" target="_blank">Unix domain socket</a>. For this purpose, for <code>server</code> element in the Loginom Integrator configuration file <code>unixsocket</code> attribute must be added. Its value matches the value of "Unix socket" parameter set in the <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/admin/parameters.html" target="_blank">connection parameters</a> on "Administration" page in Loginom Server.</p>

<p>When installing Loginom Integrator, it is possible to set Unix Socket parameter in the customization dialog. The default value of this parameter for all editions is <code>%ProgramData%\Loginom\Server\loginomd.socket</code>.</p>

<p>Algorithm of Loginom Integrator connection to Loginom Server is described below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>if <code>unixsocket</code> and <code>host</code> attributes are specified in the Integrator configuration file, first, an attempt to establish connection to unix socket is made, and if that failed, TCP is used for connection;</li>
	<li>if no <code>server</code> elemet is specified in the configuration file, first, an attempt to establish connection to unix socket is made, and then TCP is used for connection;</li>
	<li>connection only to unix socket is used in Integrator Team.</li>
</ul>

<p>If Loginom Server is not on <code>localhost</code> relative to Integrator, when installing Loginom Integrator, Unix Socket parameter value set by default must be deleted (leave the field empty) to avoid unnecessary connection attempts.</p>

<p>Logged server connection/disconnection messages, etc. are generated taking into account the protocol via which connection is established.</p>

<p>Now it is possible to create <code>unix socket</code> in Loginom Server Team if there is no <code>Bindings</code> element in the configuration file. Socket file is created in the work Loginom Server directory, and it has loginomd.socket name.</p>

<p>Connection via Unix domain socket when using docker containers eliminates the need to create the virtual network between containers. Besides, performance is higher when connecting via UDS both for Linux, and for Windows.</p>

<p>Processing of <code>X-Forwarded-Proto</code> and <code>X-Forwarded-Host</code> headers was added. These headers influence the generated URLs in OpenAPI documents and on help page for REST service.</p>

<p>Format of response SOAP messages was hanged for old packages created before version 6.3.0. The same message format as for the new packages will be used for the old ones . The user will receive corresponding message when converting.</p>

<p>It became possible to output Loginom Integrator logs to journald for the Linux version. <code>&lt;journald level="Off" maxEntrySize="65536"/&gt;</code> element was added to the configuration file. It configures logging in journald for Linux. This element is ignored for Windows. <code>maxEntrySize</code> attribute sets the maximum message size in bytes. If there is no attribute or if it contains the negative value, the following default value is used: 2147483647.</p>

<p>It became possible to output Loginom Integrator logs to the console. In <code>log</code> section of the configuration file optional <code>console</code> element was added. The level of logging to the console is configured in it. The same message format as for logging to file is used by default. But if <code>DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER</code> environment variable is set with <code>true</code> or <code>1</code> value (namely, Integrator was started from Docker container), the current date/time is not recorded in the logged messages. Logs with Warn level and higher are written in stderr, whereas the other ones in stdout. If logs are redirected from the container console to host journald, the multiline messages are divided into several ones (each line becomes a separate message in journald).</p>

<p>Error message format was changed in Loginom Integrator. The format that matches <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7807.html" target="_blank">RFC 7807</a> was implemented for RESR responses. JSON with error description is returned for the errors with code 400 in REST service. Some changes were introduced into the element structure for SOAP services.</p>

<h2 id="производительность">Performance</h2>

<p>The speed of csv files import and export was increased by 1.3 times due to transition from UTF16 to UTF-8.</p>

<p>xml files are faster processed due to transition to new libraries. For example, when converting the package from the old version to the new one, performance is increased by 1.3 times.</p>

<p>REST client operation speed was increased particularly when web service was accessed many times in one node. In some cases it occurred up to 5 times faster.</p>

<h2 id="прочие-изменения">Other Changes</h2>

<p><strong>Please note!</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The mechanism of row comparison and conversion was changed in Loginom 7. <a href="https://icu.unicode.org/" target="_blank">ICU</a> library — International Components for Unicode is used instead of built-in Windows functions. It provides the same results of work with rows on different platforms. The order of row sorting can be changed in the workflows prepared in the earlier Loginom versions.</li>
	<li>Algorithm of pseudorandom numbers generation was changed. In this regard, <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/preprocessing/sampling.html" target="_blank">Sampling</a> and <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/preprocessing/partitioning.html" target="_blank">Partitioning</a> can generate another partitioning. "Imputation with random values" method works differently in <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/preprocessing/imputation.html" target="_blank">Imputation</a> handler. "Tile" partitioning method with "Set randomly" type of matching observations processing works differently in <a href="https://help.loginom.ru/userguide/processors/preprocessing/binning.html" target="_blank">Binning</a>.</li>
	<li>Internet Explorer browser is not supported.</li>
	<li>The 32-bit version of Windows operating systems is not supported. Minimum requirements: Windows 10, Windows Server 2019.</li>
